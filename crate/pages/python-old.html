      <p>Crate data works seamlessly with Python. Crate Data is a shared-nothing,
        fully searchable, document-oriented cluster data store. It is also 100%
        open source. We built it so developers with a data intensive back-end
        won’t need to “glue” several technologies together to store documents,
        blobs and support real-time search. We also wanted to help developers
        avoid the manual work associated with tuning, sharding, replication and
        other operations required to keep a large de-normalized data store in
        good shape. We wanted a simple, failure-tolerant and massively scalable
        data store anyone can use, on a single machine, many machines or on the
        cloud.</p>
