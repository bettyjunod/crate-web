        <h2>Be Open and Open Source</h2>
      </div>
      <p>We have a strong open source background, mainly through Plone and Zope. We believe that open software is better software, and we have seen time and time again how openness enables organizations to achieve extraordinary outcomes with their data. Crate's ability to rapidly build and ship innovative software owes a great deal to the availability of high-quality open-source software that is freely available to integrate as components of larger works.</p>
      <p>A few high profile modules power various pieces of our technology stack, namely Lucene, Netty, Elasticsearch and Facebook Presto. Crate.IO delivers its software as Open Source, accessible at public open source repository on GitHub. Going forward, we will continue to release open source components of our software and make them available to the public.</p>

        <h2>Why we built Crate</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Crate.IO was founded in 2013 by Jodok Batlogg, Christian Lutz and Bernd Dorn. Our prior experience was all about working with large data sets and setting up the elements to support them. Our experience taught us to pay attention to ease of use, from simple installation to painless operation of huge clusters. Data stores should be simple for developers to use. Big Data mountains grow everywhere. Yet it is still difficult to design, develop and operate back-end services that truly scale. Underlying traditional databases don’t scale well; solutions are  expensive.</p>
      <p>There is a human factor at play, too. Finding devops personnel with extended cluster management and big data experience is difficult and costly. We offer a cluster software stack for querying, storing and searching the world’s information. We support many kinds of data including structured, unstructured, relational, temporal and geospatial, and Crate Data REALLY scales well. Our product is built with a focus on scalability, ease of use, collaboration and integration.</p>
      <p>Crate is already deployed in e-commerce, startup, mobile app, automotive and internet of things companies, and is spreading rapidly. We are deeply passionate about building great software and a successful company.</p>

      <p>Europe is filled with technology and talent. Global innovation in the last century has been driven by European minds: Tesla, Siemens, Einstein, Planck. Today, Europe still consistently produces world-class talent, but there is a gap between raw ability and the resources required to build competitive technology and companies.<br />
