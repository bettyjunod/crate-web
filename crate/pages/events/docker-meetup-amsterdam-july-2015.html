Our Developer Advocate, Chris Ward will be speaking at the Docker meetup in Amsterdam to introduce the audience to Crate and how it works with Docker and Docker tools such as Compose, Machine and Swarm.

We look forward to hearing what exciting projects the developers of Amsterdam are working and will be sticking around for drinks and further questions after the meetup. [Email Chris](mailto:chris@crate.io) if you would like to arrange extra time for a meeting.
