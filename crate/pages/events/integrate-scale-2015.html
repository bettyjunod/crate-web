Crate.IO will be attending Integrate and Scale this year, one of the largest events in the World that has a 100% focus on integration technologies.

We will be in attendance for the whole event for networking and discussions on how you might be able to benefit from using Crate.IO as a scalable backend. We are keen to meet developers, business and product owners, so if you're interested in chatting, let [us know](mailto:spanky@crate.io).
