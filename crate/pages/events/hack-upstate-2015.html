We meet the Hack Upstate team at SXSW this year and instantly bonded over hackathons, sprints (yes even <a href="/blog/snowsprint-2015">snowsprints</a>), and open source software.  While we were unable to send a developer to the event we are really excited to be a sponsor.  The project that is the "Best Use of Crate's distributed DB for Docker" will win an <a href="/blog/intel-nuc-shoebox/">IntelNUC</a>!

For those of you who will be participating in Hack Upstate, if you have any questions reach out to us on [IRC](http://en.irc2go.com/webchat/?net=freenode&room=crate), [Google Groups](Google Groups), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crateio), [email](mailto:support@crate.io) or through any of our other online <a href="community.html">Crate communities</a>.

Good luck to all of the participants we are really exited to see this year's projects!
