##Join us at Webcamp Ljubljana 2015!

Come and find out what Crate.IO is brewing and learn more about the latests developments in distributed persistent data-storages within the Docker ecosystem. 

We shall have a presentation on "Understanding databases for distributed Docker applications." 

We’ll focus on the use of databases, specifically Crate in Docker containers, locally and in the cloud, the technical challenges and best practices learned. You’ll learn about the reasons why Crate.IO is building “yet another NoSQL database” and why it’s unique and important when running containerized applications. Also we shall speak about why the shared-nothing architecture is so important when deploying large clusters of containers.

[Kenan Salihbegovic](https://twitter.com/xsolid) shall be available on site for your for all your questions or to simply share a cup of coffee or tea with you.

## Where &amp; When?

Join us at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana on March the 15th.

## What is Crate?

Crate is a new breed of database to serve today’s mammoth data needs. Based on the familiar SQL syntax, Crate combines high availability, resiliency, and scalability in a distributed design that allows you to query mountains of data in realtime, not batches. A shared-nothing, fully searchable, document- oriented clustered data store, it’s the perfect highly available backend for your web scale services. Semi-structured data alongside binary objects, all accessible via SQL.
