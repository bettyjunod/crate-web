Crate.IO will be at Europython this year.

Join our CTO Bernd on **23 July, 2-5pm** for a training on
**“Test driven development of a horizontal scaling REST-Service with Pyramids, Crate and SQLAlchemy”**.
You will learn about how a simple application can be developed and tested
in a sandboxed environment and then deployed to a multi-node cluster leaveraging
a shared nothing data store.

Our goal is to make any computer in the room part
of the cluster to provide compute and storage power to our service.
