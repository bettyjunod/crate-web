**“3 years after studiVZ ... challenges, problems and how to solve them with today’s technologies”**
at the International PHP Conference in Munich.

Sebastian Utz was one of the Software Architects at studiVZ and responsible
for the scaling of the platform. Basti, who delivered up to 70 percent of the
platform features, needed massive workarounds and tweaks to withstand the load
of approximately 17 millions of active users. Listen to Sebastian on the

how he managed to overcome such issues.
