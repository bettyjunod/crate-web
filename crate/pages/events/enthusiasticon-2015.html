Crate.IO will be speaking at this community event for those passionate about programming.

Our Developer Advocate Chris will give two 10 minute presentations, one on what it means to be a 'Developer Advocate' and one on 'Printing the Web' a slightly esoteric presentation on how to make our modern websites into perfect print versions.
