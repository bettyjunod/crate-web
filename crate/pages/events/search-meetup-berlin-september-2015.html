The Berlin Elastic Search Usergroup is back! Crate are super excited to be asked back to talk about how and why we took Elastic Search and built a data store on top of it.

Matthias Wahl, one of Crate's core developers will present an in-depth look at the subject and looks forward to explaining the journey.
