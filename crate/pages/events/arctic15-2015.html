Crate.IO will be attending this pre-eminent event for Nordic and Scandinavian startups.

Our Developer Advocate, Chris Ward will be in attendance for the whole event for networking and discussions on how your startup might be able to benefit from using Crate.IO as a scalable backend. We also hope to be attending some developer events around the same time so if you're interested in chatting, let [Chris know](mailto:chris@crate.io).
