##Join us the CityOS Hackathon in Sarajevo

Crate.io will be attending this event.

Our Developer Advocate, Kenan Salihbegovic will be a featured speaker at the first day of the conference and available afterwards for the whole event for networking and discussions on how your startup might be able to benefit from using crate.io's scalable backend. We also hope to be attending some developer events around the same time so if you're interested in chatting, let [Kenan know](mailto:kenan@crate.io). 

Say hello on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CrateIO) or [Facebook](https://fb.me/cratedata) if you want to have a one on one meeting with us.

## What is Crate?

Crate is a new breed of database to serve today’s mammoth data needs. Based on the familiar SQL syntax, Crate combines high availability, resiliency, and scalability in a distributed design that allows you to query mountains of data in real time, not batches. A shared-nothing, fully searchable, document- oriented clustered data store, it’s the perfect highly available backend for your web scale services. Semi-structured data alongside binary objects, all accessible via SQL.

_Come join us!_
