Our Developer Advocate, Christian Haudum will be speaking at the Docker meetup in London to introduce the audience to Crate and how it works with Docker and Docker tools such as Compose, Machine and Swarm.

We look forward to hearing what exciting projects the developers of London are working and will be sticking around for drinks and further questions after the meetup. [Email Christian](mailto:christian.haudum@crate.io) if you would like to arrange extra time for a meeting.
