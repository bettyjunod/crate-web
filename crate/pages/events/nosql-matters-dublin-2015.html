We will be presenting "Understanding databases for distributed Docker applications" at NoSQL Matters in Dublin. This is a fantastic event for anyone involved with or interested in NoSQL and Big Data development.

We look forward to meeting you there and discussing how Crate.IO can help you with your Big Data applications and how it fits into the NoSQL ecosystem.
