        <h2>Installing Crate:</h2>

        <p>One the major themes here at Crate.io is simplicity, in fact it's one of the primary reasons we buit Crate: the belief that running a scalable, distributed backend should be approachable by everyone. From a 2-person startup team to the enterprise company with a full IT staff, Crate is easy to install, manage, and scale.</p>
