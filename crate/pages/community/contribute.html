        <h2>Request Features &amp; Report Issues</h2>
        <p>We are aware that many features have to be added over time. In order to help prioritize we also want to get your feedback. Just open an <a href="https://github.com/crate/crate/issues" target="_blank">issue on Github</a> and describe the feature you want and how it should work. If you explain why you're making the feature request, we may find a way to help you.</p>
        <p>Before reporting an issue, make sure you use the latest version of Crate and search our issues list on Github, it may be already tracked and in the pipeline. If possible help us in reproducing the bug by delivering a small test case so we can run a test against it.</p>

        <h2>Contribute Code</h2>
        <p>We appreciate your ideas and help. Before you start to contribute please contact us (e.g. in #crate on Freenode IRC), just to make sure nobody else is already working on that problem or feature. In order to optimize the way things get solved it is best to find the best approach with us before writing too much code - we want your code to get accepted!</p>
