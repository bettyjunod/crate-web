# Join our Sales Engineering Team!
Crate revolutionizes the way scalable backends are built. Instead of nailing together different services to build a backend data store and wondering how to scale when data grows from millions to billions, Crate's distributed SQL database offers the simplicity and scalability that is needed from the outset. We believe in open source and know that open software is better software.

We are a technology startup - Winner of TechCrunch Disrupt 2014 - backed by Sunstone Capital and Draper Esprit (formerly DFJ Esprit) and are located in the center of the startup epicenter Kreuzberg, Berlin. We have offices in San Francisco and Austria, so expect to see the sea and mountains now and then.

## Your Responsibilities
- As a Sales Engineer you will work closely with companies that evaluate and test Crate.IO to solve their scaling issues.
- Our users are distributed between US, Europe and Asia. Successful sales engineers understand their growing data processing needs and identify promising companies and build a relation with them.
- Working on the content of our Website, Code Examples, Demonstrators
- You will work closely with our teams and offices in Dornbirn and San Francisco

## Must Have
- Respected by developers. You need to be able to be a credible partner in a technical conversation. Previous roles as a developer (mobile/web/other), product manager with a developer background or sales engineer are preferred.
- Ideally you have already a great track record in working with enterprises and sales.
- Technical background: Proficiency in multiple programming languages (Python, Ruby, Java, Objective C, JavaScript, C++, etc.) and a clear desire to learn.
- Familiarity with other up-to-date technologies and trends a plus
- Experience in fields relating to Crate, such as databases, scalable databases, NoSQL or large scale applications a plus.

## Your Personal Profile
- **Customer oriented**. We live and die by the Crate Users. You should be spending as much time as possible talking to customers and understand their needs. You reach out and start the conversation. You find users who decided not to use Crate and talk to them too.
- **Agile**. Startup marketing means working with unknowns. The product changes daily, marketing messages are invented and discarded, and just when you think you've got the right combination the world changes around you.
- **Self-motivated**. There will not always be a set list of tasks to work on, but rather a set of goals we are aiming towards. You will be expected to identify the tasks, people and methods for accomplishing these and feel confident in your decisions to get started.
- **Willing to learn detail**. You need to know what you're talking about. We're building a distributed data store where people store their data! While you probably won't know this on the first day, you need to be interested in understanding our market, our customers and our product.
- **A traveller and love to engage with people**. We have users from all over the world. Your focus is the startup hubs like Berlin, London, Stockholm or even San Francisco, the bay area and Silicon valley.
- **Devoted to measurement**. You truly embrace measurement. This helps to understand the effect of what we do.

## What We Offer
- Market-based compensation
- Young and dynamic team
- International Flair
- Central and modern office
- The opportunity to become part of one of the most exciting startups in the IT scene (Winner of TechCrunch Disrupt Europe 2014)

## HIRING PROCESS
1. After reviewing your profile we'll schedule a video interview with one of the founders Jodok and/or Christian.
2. The next step is a face-to-face meeting with the team at the closest office (Berlin, Dornbirn or San Francisco)
3. You'll get an amazing job offer :)

We try hard to make this process as quick and smooth as possible. We promise to respond quickly and respect your time.
