We are proud to announce that Crate.IO is a gold sponsor for DockerCon 2015. 

After attending DockerCon in Amsterdam last year we fell in love with Docker and wanted get involved with the community.  <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/01/dockercon-eu-introducing-docker-swarm/">Docker Swarm</a> and <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/01/dockercon-eu-introducing-docker-compose/">Docker Compose</a> made their debut in at DockerCon last year (we have found both tools to be extremely <a href="{% url '/blog/deploying-crate-with-docker-machine-swarm.html' %}">helpful</a>) and we can't wait to see what announcements will be made this year.

Join the Crate team at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dockercon-sf-hackathon-tickets-15613226581">Hackathon</a>, come to one of our talks during the conference, or visit us at our booth. Get your <a href="http://www.dockercon.com/">tickets</a> today!
