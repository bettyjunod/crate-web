The VoIPstudio Telecom system is a unique cloud system running on a large amount of servers in a wide variety of locations. Each data center has two basic roles: storing data in real-time and backup for other locations in the cloud system.

This results in a lot of data that has to be processed around the globe. Retrieving data in this environment is complex and fetching results can be time consuming.

>"How complex is our implementation? Imagine over one hundred servers in several data centers on both sides of the Atlantic. Implementation was smooth and the whole cloud system is now configured on secured layers, one of which is Crate.IO.",

Says Martin Ozarek of Level7Systems

VoIPstudio was looking for new a solution to store CDRs (Call Detail Records). MySQL had been used successfully for several years but due to increasingly poor performance it was abandoned.

>"The first problem we had to solve was importing lots of data. Our data is stored in the cloud using many locations and machines. We had to stay online for customers and import data into Crate.IO at the same time. As we are providing services for clients all over the world we couldnâ€™t take a break for maintenance. As a telephone provider, we have to support our customers with the best telephone solution 24/7. The number of records was already over 100,000,000 and growing every minute. The whole process took almost one week."

>"After a successful and problem free implementation it became clear to us that Crate.IO was the solution we were looking for. We gained better performance and new possibilities for our customers. We are going to improve and extend our cloud system using Crate.IO."

For one table with about 25-30 million records, MySQL needed 10 to 15 seconds to execute the query. Now with Crate.IO it takes less than 500 milliseconds (that's impressive performance).
