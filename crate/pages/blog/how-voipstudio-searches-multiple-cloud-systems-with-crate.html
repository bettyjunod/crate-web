The VoIPstudio Telecom system is a unique cloud system running on a large amount of servers in a wide variety of locations. Each data center has two basic roles: storing data in real-time and backup for other locations in the system.

This results in a lot of data that has to be processed around the globe. Retrieving data in this environment is complex and fetching results can be time consuming.

>"How complex is our implementation? Imagine over one hundred servers in several data centers on both sides of the Atlantic. Implementation was smooth and the whole cloud system is now configured on secured layers, one of which is Crate.",

Says Martin Ozarek of Level 7 Systems

VoIPstudio was looking for new a solution to store CDRs (Call Detail Records). MySQL had been used successfully for several years but due to increasingly poor performance it was abandoned.

The first problem Level 7 Systems had to solve was importing lots of data from many machines in many locations. They had to stay online for customers and import data at the same time, VoIPstudio provides services for clients all over the world and can't take a break for maintenance. As a telephone provider, they have to support customers with the best telephone solution 24/7. The number of records was already over 100,000,000 and growing every minute. The import process took almost one week.

Previously one table with about 25-30 million records using MySQL needed 10 to 15 seconds to execute the query. Now with Crate it takes less than 500 milliseconds and that performance impressed Level 7 Systems.

>"After a successful and problem free implementation it became clear to us that Crate was the solution we were looking for. We gained better performance and new possibilities for our customers. We are going to improve and extend our cloud system using Crate."

Currently VoIPstudio doesn't use the [official Crate PHP driver](/docs/clients/) as it was missing some features required. These were:

* Driver level Crate server failover
* Asynchronous cross data center replication (implemented with [Gearman](http://gearman.org))

To accomplish this functionality, Level 7 Systems implemented their own custom Crate PHP driver.
