We were invited by the German [com! Magazin](http://www.com-magazin.de) to hold a webinar about distributed databases and Crate.

Christian spoke about distributed systems in general, distributed databases (DDBSs) and the difficulties you face when you build one.
He was also talking about why we nevertheless built Crate, how it works and how it is different to other databases.

Finally in his demo he showed how to build a Crate cluster within minutes using Docker.
