Docker is currently one of the most spoken about tech projects right now and it's hard to believe that it's only two years old. As part of the celebrations, the Docker team decided to host [more than a dozen open-source-a-thon parties](http://docker.party/events/) around the World. Not only to help people learn how to contribute to the project, but also donating $50 for every contribution to the [Oceanic Society](http://www.oceanicsociety.org/).

The Crate team were able to attend two events as part of the celebrations, one in Berlin and one in San Fransisco, here's what happened.

### Berlin
First up was the party in [Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Berlin/events/220945833/) and it was held at Souncloud's main office in its vast Kitchen area. We took a crate of cakes along which were greatly appreciated as hacker fuel.

After a quick introduction on how to get involved, the 100+ participants broke out into areas of interest and experience. These were Beginner, Advanced and Documentation. I opted to lend a hand with documentation as I have no experience in coding with Go and always like getting involved with documentation as I feel it's an area of Open Source project contribution that can get forgotten. I helped a small group get up and running with Docker and we looked through some issues together, managing to submit fixes for several, hopefully also raising a few hundred dollars for the Oceanic Society.

### San Francisco

### Get Involved
If you weren't able to attend a Docker Party event, you can still be involved in the [online open-source-a-thon](http://docker.party/online/) and all contributions until April 19th will still count as part of the party celebrations and charity donations. Full instructions can be found on the same site.
