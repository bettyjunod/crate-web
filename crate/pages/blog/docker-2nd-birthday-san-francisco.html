Docker is currently one of the most spoken about tech projects right now and it's hard to believe that it's only two years old. As part of the celebrations, the Docker team decided to host [more than a dozen open-source-a-thon parties](http://docker.party/events/) around the World. Not only to help people learn how to contribute to the project, but also donating $50 for every contribution to the [Oceanic Society](http://www.oceanicsociety.org/).

In our second blog post as part of the celebrations, we brought our laptops, ideas and a present for the team to Docker's headquarters in [San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-meetups/events/220935945/). 

With over 200 people RSVP'd it was standing room only as the party started off with a introduction to the project and an explanation of how to get involved. Then we broke off into teams based on interest and expertise level.  People we working on huge variety of Docker projects, from _____ to ____ and a lot of teams had core contributors there helping out.  I found the small army of volunteer mentors running around to be extremely helpful, they could help with anything, from a weird Git issues to chasing down bugs.

It was an an extremely successful night, not only I was I able to meet the Docker leadership, talk to the core team and learn from other community members but I was also able to contribute to a open source project I use everyday while helping raise money for the Oceanic Society.

From myself, and everyone else on the Crate team, happy birthday Docker! We hope you enjoy the collage, as an open source company that puts community first we wanted to show you what that means.  




Not only was I able to meet the folks thatI enjoyed hearing from the Docker leadership, core team members, and from community members It was exciting to learn where Docker is heading as a project and how other are using it.  




After a quick introduction on how to get involved, the 100+ participants broke out into areas of interest and experience. These were Beginner, Advanced and Documentation working on various tools such as Core Docker, Swarm, Compose and Machine. I opted to lend a hand with documentation as I have no experience in coding with Go and always like getting involved with documentation as I feel it's an area of Open Source project contribution that can get forgotten. I helped a small group get up and running with Docker and we looked through some issues together, managing to submit fixes for several, hopefully also raising a few hundred dollars for the Oceanic Society.



If you weren't able to attend a Docker Party event, you can still be involved in the [online open-source-a-thon](http://docker.party/online/) and all contributions until April 19th will still count as part of the party celebrations and charity donations. Full instructions can be found on the same site.
