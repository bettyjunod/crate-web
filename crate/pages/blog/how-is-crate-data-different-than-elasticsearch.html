People ask us whether Crate.IO is a SQL layer on top of Elasticsearch. Although we use Elasticsearch as a framework, as explained [here](/blog/using-elasticsearch-as-part-of-the-crate-data-store/), Crate is a data store, and as a result has some noticeable differences. Crate is a distributed system that runs on one machine or a cluster of machines. Crate comes in one complete install package. It includes solid established open source components (Presto, Elasticsearch, Lucene, Netty) and extends those with added core functionalities like read/write support, SQL language, dashboard and query console. Here are some of the differences between Crate.IO, as a datastore, and using Elasticsearch: 

## Full Array Support

Since version `0.46` Crate fully supports array types.
Whereas Elasticsearch does not strictly distinguish between [arrays](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-array-type.html) and core types (a string type can be string or string array depending how you insert it), Crate does strictly differenciate between these and handles them differently.
Therefore Crate has support for recursively guessing the inner type of arrays and storing it correctly in the internal mapping even if they are inserted into a dynamic table schema.

## Blob Storage

One of the design goals behind [Crate](/download/) was to be more than a database, offering a complete solution that covers blob storage as well, and offering the opportunity to replace expensive network storage solutions with cheap commodity hardware. Crate’s blob storage functions include sharding, replication and rebalancing. You can read about them [here](https://crate.io/blog/using-crate-data-as-a-blobstore/). Additionally, this can enable storing data on a self-hosted cluster rather than on the public cloud (we are planning an AWS S3 compatible blob API).

Elasticsearch, on the other hand, doesn’t support blob storage. Typically, it is used together with GridFS or HDFS for blob storage.

## Distributed Accurate Aggregations

Elasticsearch currently supports the HyperLogLog aggregations, whereas Crate.IO supports accurate aggregations. Also Elasticsearch scatters the queries to all nodes, gathering the responses and doing the aggregations afterwards which results in high memory consumption on the node that is handling the client request (and so doing the aggregation).

Crate distributes the collected results to the whole cluster using a simple modulo based hashing, and as a result uses the complete memory of the cluster for merging. Think of it as some kind of distributed map/reduce.

## Partitioned Tables

Crate supports the creation of partitioned tables, which transparently partition your data based on a defined column, like e.g. Hive does.

Elasticsearch supports creating aliases of a table which can be used to achieve the same, but it’s up to the application developer to implement this.

## Import/Export

Crate.IO supports `COPY FROM` / `TO` sql statements for exporting or importing data.

Compared to Elasticsearch’s backup feature, Crate doesn’t take snapshots of the lucene indices, but exports/imports the data in a JSON format, making it easily processable with common tools if needed.

## Update by Query

With Crate its possible to update one or multiple documents using a query (`WHERE` clause).

Elasticsearch only supports updates of a single document using its `_id` field value.

## Insert by Query

Crate.IO supports data insertion using a query instead of values. Elasticsearch does not support this out-of-the-box. This feature can also be used to restructure the tables data, renaming a field, changing a field's data type or converting a normal table into a partitioned one.

## Integrated Admin-UI

Crate is shipped with an integrated open source Admin-UI, showing the cluster, node and table state, a simple “Getting Started" twitter import example, notifications of news and new available Crate.IO releases and also a SQL console.
