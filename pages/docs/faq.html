    <h3>Q: What platform does Crate run on?</h3>
    <p>Crate is written in Java and therefore platform independent (tested on Linux systems, OSX and Windows). Crate only needs a working Java 7 virtual machine. We recommend using Oracleâ€™s Java on OSX and OpenJDK on Linux Systems. Check out the <a href="/docs/en/latest/installation.html">Installation</a> section in our documentation.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: How do I install Crate?</h3>
    <p>Crate is easy to install. Visit the <a href="{% url '/install/index.html' %}">Download</a> page for instructions.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: What do I need to consider when setting up a Crate cluster?</h3>
    <p>Crate is a distributed datastore by design so in a production environment you usually have a cluster of 3 or more nodes. We at Crate.IO try to make the cluster setup as easy as possible. You can find a <a href="/docs/en/latest/best_practice/multi_node_setup.html">step-by-step guide</a> in our documentation.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: Is there a limit on how many nodes a Crate cluster can have.</h3>
    <p>No. You can add as many instances as you want to the cluster. The more nodes, the more powerful the cluster gets!</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: Is there a limit of memory I can use?</h3>
    <p>No. We recommend to set the maximum heap size so that there is still space for the file system cache. However it is not recommended to exceed a maximum heap size of 32GB, because more would disable the Java pointer compression of the JVM. For more information please check the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html">Oracle Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/configuration.html#crate-heap-size">Configuration</a> section in our documentation. If you want to increase the total memory of the cluster you should to add more nodes.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: How can I inspect my data?</h3>
    <p>You can query your own data, the <a href="/docs/en/latest/sql/information_schema.html">information schema</a> and other <a href="/docs/en/latest/sql/system.html">system tables</a> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>.</p>
    <p>Crate also ships with a graphical user interface &#8211; or short <a href="https://github.com/crate/crate-admin/">Admin UI</a> &#8211; to inspect not only your data but also the current state of your cluster.  It's accessible from the browser on every node on port <code>4200</code> at the URL <code>/admin/</code> (e.g. <code>http://127.0.0.1:4200/admin/</code> for a local installation).</p>
    <p>There is also a command line interface for Crate called crash written in Python. For installation instructions check out the <a href="https://github.com/crate/crash/">Github project</a> and read the <a href="https://crate.io/docs/projects/crash/stable/">documentation</a> for usage.</p>

    <h3>Q: What drivers are there that I can use in my application?</h3>
    <p>Crate has drivers in several programming languages. Check out the <a href="{% url '/docs/index.html' %}">Download page</a> for a complete list of libraries.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: What is the best way to migrate my data from MongoDB to Crate?</h3>
    <p>We provide a <a href="/docs/en/latest/best_practice/migrating_from_mongodb.html">best practice how to migration your data from MongoDB</a> to Crate.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: What is the best way to migrate my data from MySQL to Crate?</h3>
    <p>We also have a <a href="/docs/en/latest/best_practice/migrating_from_mysql.html">best practice how to migration from MySQL</a> to Crate.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: Does Crate do transactions?</h3>
    <p>No, Crate does not support transactions but does support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">Optimistic Concurrency Control</a> which allows conflict resolution on the client side.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Q: Does Crate support JOINs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, Crate does have a first, basic support for JOINs since version <code>0.53.0</code>.
    Please consulte the <a href="/docs/en/latest/sql/joins.html">JOIN</a> page in the documentation for further details.
    We're working on improving the performance and adding a more complete support for all types of JOINs.</p>
    <p>However, for many use cases there are other ways to achieve the same result as a JOIN. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/en/latest/sql/data_types.html#array">ARRAY</a> and <a href="/docs/en/latest/sql/data_types.html#object">OBJECT</a> data types to denormalise your data.</p>
    <hr />

      <h3>Q: Does Crate have a built-in user/permission management?</h3>
      <p>No. You will need to secure your Crate installation/cluster with the administration weapons of your choice, e.g. firewall rules. You find information about that in the documentation about <a href="/docs/en/latest/best_practice/multi_node_setup.html">Multi Node Setup</a>.</p>
