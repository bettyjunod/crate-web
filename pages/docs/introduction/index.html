title: Introducing Crate.IO
author: Chris Ward

There comes a time in the life of every database when it's not enough anymore. It becomes unreliable, too dependent on 3rd party components to provide necessary functionality and can no longer grow with your needs efficiently.

Crate.IO understands that switching from a familiar, but unreliable database is hard and we aim to make that process as simple and painless as possible.

## Put data to work. Simply
We live in a fast moving, data rich world that's only getting faster and more complex by the day. Which is why we've crafted a new kind of data solution: a super simple, infinitely scalable SQL database that functions at the speed of your business, delivering instant results.

Crate.IO fits snugly into your existing architecture, putting your data to work seamlessly alongside your applications. And makes your business simply sustainable as you grow.

## A distributed and scalable solution that suits your needs
Crate is a distributed data store. Install Crate directly on your application servers and make the monolithic centralized database a thing of the past. Crate takes care of synchronization, [sharding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)), [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling), and [replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)) even for mammoth data sets. If a node becomes unavailable, Crate self-heals and rebalances the cluster automatically.

Our container images, one-click installers, client libraries and SQL query engine will help Crate fit right in with your existing application stack.

## A full solution built on solid components
All nodes in a Crate Cluster are equal, a [shared-nothing architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_nothing_architecture) that makes configuration easy.  On each node, the handler component receives and processes client requests. After parsing, SQL queries are analyzed and executed in a distributed manner. To calculate the final result, remote nodes collect intermediate results and merge them in the next phase. To make [BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object) delivery fast, nodes stream results directly.

Crate is one complete install package. It includes solid established open source components ([Presto](https://prestodb.io/), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/), [Netty](http://netty.io/)) and extends them with added core functionality like read/write support, SQL parsing, admin dashboard and a query console.

## Try Crate now
We have a 3-instance cluster setup for you to try out, head over to [play.crate.io](https://play.crate.io/_plugin/crate-admin/#/) and go crazy!
