## Find the Answers you Need, Instantly (UC #1)
Crate offers a comprehensive selection of tools to suit the needs of many business requirements. From analyzing large data sets and text records in real-time to find the details you need, to storing and retrieving media files, Crate has what you're looking for.

Whilst other solutions make your developers learn new and single-purpose skills to use them, with Crate they can use familiar and established knowledge to gain new potential.

## Crate is the only solution you need (UC #2)
If you've ever developed an application that used a traditional database for storing data you'll know the complexities of adding search features beyond SQL `like` queries. Typically this has involved integrating additional components to your application stack such as Lucene, Solr or Elastic Search. This search index then needs to synchronized with data changes and maintained.

Crate includes comprehensive built-in full text search features alongside SQL and BLOB storage, available in queries with other fields in the same tables.

## Full Text Search (UC #3)
With Crate, full text search and analysis of column values is comprehensive and fast. Let's look at a couple of examples.

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM tweets
WHERE match(source, 'Android iPhone');
```

This query searches the `source` field of a tweet to count how many users were using mobile clients to send their 140 characters.

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM tweets
WHERE NOT match(source, 'Twitter');
```

Whereas this query searches the same field to count how many users were not using official Twitter clients.

The `match()` statement is where the magic happens and allows for a [wide variety of analysis](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/analyzer.html) options.
