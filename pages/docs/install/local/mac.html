title: Installing Crate.IO on Mac
author: Chris Ward

Installing and running Crate on a Mac requires just one simple command in your terminal application:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"
```

To create a cluster, run the command multiple times to create new instances that will discover each when running on the same machine.
