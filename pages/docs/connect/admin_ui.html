title: Manage your Cluster with the Crate Admin UI
author: Chris Ward

Crate ships with an Admin UI that provides an overview of your cluster, nodes, tables and much more.

## Connect to Cluster
To Connect to Crate Cluster, open the following url:

*http://SERVER_IP:4200/admin*

`SERVER_IP` is the publicly accessible IP address of any node in the Crate cluster.

## Admin UI Features
### Overview Bar and Tab
![Crate Admin UI Nav Bar]({% media '/media/1512/admin_ui_infobar.png' %})

At the top of the browser window is overview information about the cluster that shows, from left to right:

- The name of the cluster, find out [how to change its value our configuration documentation](https://crate.io/docs/reference/configuration.html#cluster-name)
- The version of Crate that the cluster is running.
- The number of nodes in the cluster.
- The health of the data in the cluster. Green indicates that all data is replicated and available, yellow that there are unreplicated records and red that data is unavailable.
- Potential configuration problems and recommendations for the cluster.
- Average cluster load over the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
- Link to Crate documentation.
- Latest news from Crate.

The overview tab displays similar information to the bar but with more details on data availability, cluster load and problems.

On the left hand side of the window you will see four further tabs.

### Get Started Tab
Provides an easy way to import the latest tweets from Twitters public timeline for a data set to experiment with.

### Console Tab
An interactive terminal to try querying data sets and view the results.

### Tables Tab
Gives an overview of document and blob tables present in the Crate cluster. This includes schema, shards, partitions, size and the data availability across the table.

### Cluster Tab
Provides an overview of nodes in the cluster including details such as load, CPU usage, shards on the node and hostname.
