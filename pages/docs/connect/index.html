title: Connect to a Cluster
author: Chris Ward

To Connect to your Crate Cluster, you will need to know the IP or DNS address of one node in the cluster and Crate uses port *4200* for HTTP transport. You then have several options available, our [Admin UI](admin_ui/), our [CLI tool](crash/) (Crash) and a [REST API](/docs/getting-started/clients/rest/).
