## Delivers Fast Results
Crate is blisteringly fast, often offering superior performance with less hardware when compared to other solutions. This improves a customer's experience, saves you money and maintenance time and helps you grow efficiently.

Even with infrastructure spread across data centers and geographical locations, you can expect the results of a query on millions of records within milliseconds.

## A Solution to Suit your Changing Needs
Have you reached the limits of your current database and is it reducing your ability to craft a great application? As a simple drop in replacement or to run alongside your current solution, it's worth trying Crate.

A Distributed database such as Crate removes the typical bottleneck of a limited amount of write destinations. Whilst scaling and performance tweaking a traditional relational database is possible, it's a complex process that can consume way too much time that could be better spent.

### How does Crate compare?

Solution | Infrastructure | 'Query' Speed
-------- | :------------: | ------------:
MySQL    | xmb, xghz      |           xms
MongoDB  | 16 nodes       |        0.8 ms
Crate    | 16 nodes       |      0.008 ms

### Handles Complexity Efficiently
If your application relies on [aggregation](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/aggregation.html) or [scalar functions](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/scalar.html), [full text search](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/fulltext.html) or [blob storage](https://crate.io/docs/stable/blob.html), let Crate handle it for you with no performance hit.

## Highly Configurable
Crate can handle a lot of complexity for you, but when you're looking for more control to get the maximum performance possible for your application, we can offer it.

### Schema and table Creation / Providing a solid base
Thanks to Crate's NoSQL underpinnings, strict schema definitions are not always needed. If you want to define a schema and configure your tables more precisely, we recommend you [read our best practice guide](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/ddl.html) on the topic.

### Managing Demand
The typical approach to cope with fluctuating demand on a database is to scale a cluster as appropriate. Whilst there are other database solutions that deliver scalability, scaling Crate really is as simple as adding or removing instances.

If you are looking for more control over the management of your cluster, the following topics might be of interest to you:
