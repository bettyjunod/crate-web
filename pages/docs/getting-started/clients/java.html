title: Connecting to Crate with Java
author: Chris Ward

## JDBC
### Maven
The simplest way to connect to a Crate cluster with the Crate JDBC driver is to visit the drivers page on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view) and click the 'Set Me Up' button. This will give you Maven settings that can be pasted into your current project or downloaded for a new project.

### Gradle
```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate"
    }
}
```
