title: Connecting to Crate with Java
author: Chris Ward

## Java Client
### Add Crate to you Project
A simple way to configure your project to connect to a Crate cluster is to visit the Java client page on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-client/view) and click the 'Set Me Up' button. This will give you a Maven or Gradle configuration that can be pasted into your current project or downloaded for a new project.

For manual configuration follow these steps depending on your build system of choice.

#### Maven

Add the following to your *pom.xml* file:

```xml
...
<repositories>
  ...
  <repository>
      <snapshots>
          <enabled>false</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      <id>central</id>
      <name>bintray</name>
      <url>http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
      <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
      <artifactId>crate-client</artifactId>
      <version>VERSION</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```

#### Gradle
Add Crate as a dependency to your Gradle file:

```gradle
repositories {
  ...
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
  compile 'io.crate:crate-client:VERSION'
  ...
}
```

### Connect to Crate

Import the Crate client and create a new client object:

```java
import io.crate.client.CrateClient;
...
CrateClient client = new CrateClient(
    "NODE1_IP:4300",
    "NODE2_IP:4300"
    ...
);
```

Whilst it's possible to just connect to one node in a cluster, we recommend specifying all nodes to allow for automatic routing to another node if one becomes available.

## JDBC

### Add Crate to your Project
A simple way to configure your project to connect to a Crate cluster is to visit the JDBC driver page on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view) and click the 'Set Me Up' button. This will give you a Maven or Gradle configuration that can be pasted into your current project or downloaded for a new project.

For manual configuration follow these steps depending on your build system of choice.

#### Maven

Add the following to your *pom.xml* file:

```xml
...
<repositories>
    ...
    <repository>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
        <id>central</id>
        <name>bintray</name>
        <url>http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
        <artifactId>crate-jdbc</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```

#### Gradle
Add Crate as a dependency to your Gradle file:

```gradle
   repositories {
        ...
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'io.crate:crate-jdbc:VERSION'
        ...
    }
```

### Connect to Crate
The Crate JDBC driver class is `io.crate.client.jdbc.CrateDriver`.

Connect to your Crate cluster with the Java DriverManager:

```java
Class.forName("io.crate.client.jdbc.CrateDriver");
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("crate://SERVER_IP:4300");
```
