title: Using Crate with SQuirreL SQL
author: Chris Ward

[SQuirreL](http://www.squirrelsql.org) is a graphical SQL client that can be used to browse and query JDBC compliant database.

Crate can be used with SQuirreL thanks to our [JDBC](/docs/reference/jdbc/) driver.

## Setup
SQuirreL does not provide a Crate driver with its distribution, so an extra step is required to run Crate with SQuirreL:

1. Copy the latest [JDBC standalone jar](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view/files/io/crate/crate-jdbc-standalone) to the SQuirreL _lib_ folder. When installing SQuirreL with the MaxOS X installer, this is _/Applications/SQuirreLSQL.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib/_.
2. Start SQuirreL.
3. Choose the _Drivers_ tab and add a new driver, adding the relevant details and press _ok_.

![squirrel add driver dialogue]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_add_driver.png' %})

4. Choose the _Aliases_ tab and add a new Alias, choose your new driver (_crate_ in our example) and enter the database URL. Username and password are not supported, so leave them blank.

![squirrel add alias dialogue]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_add_alias.png' %})

5. Connect your alias to your crate instance.

## Usage
You can browse Crate using the _Object Tree Worksheet_, the usual view used for browsing tables and getting schema information.

![browsing the content and schema of a table using squirrel]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_view.png' %})

When browsing a table's content using _Content_, it's possible to edit the table contents by _right-clicking_ and choosing _Make Editable_.

![editing the content of a table using squirrel]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_edit.png' %})

Using the SQuirreL SQL Editor it's possible to execute arbitrary SQL commands and scripts.
