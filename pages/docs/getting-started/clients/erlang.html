title: Connecting to Crate with Erlang
author: Chris Ward

The Crate Erlang client is built using [rebar3](https://github.com/rebar/rebar3) and we recommend you use it in your project for compiling and testing.

## Add Crate to your Project
To add Crate as a dependency, add the following to your _rebar.config_ file.

```erlang
{deps,[
  {craterl,"0.2.3"}
]}.
```

And run:

```bash
rebar update
```
