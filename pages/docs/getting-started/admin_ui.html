# Admin UI
![Crate Admin UI](admin_ui.png)

Crate ships with an admin UI by default that provides several features, we'll break them down by each of the five tabs on the left hand side:
- **Overview**: Displays an overview of your cluster state, load across the nodes in the cluster and its general health based on data replication and availability.
- **Get Started**: Provides a button to import the latest tweets from Twitters public timeline for a data set to experiment with.
- **Console**: An interactive terminal to try queries and view the results.
- **Tables**: Displays Table and partition schema and health.
- **Cluster**: A more detailed view of the health and load of each node in the cluster.

The _Console_ tab is most useful to us right now, allowing to issue SQL and other commands.
