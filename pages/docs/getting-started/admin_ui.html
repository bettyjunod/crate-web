title: Manage your Cluster with the Crate Admin UI
author: Chris Ward

Crate ships with an Admin UI that provides an overview of your cluster, nodes, tables and much more.

## Connect to Cluster
To connect to your Crate cluster, open the following url:

*http://SERVER_IP:4200/admin*

`SERVER_IP` is the publicly accessible IP address of any node in the Crate cluster.

## Admin UI Overview
You will see five tabs on the left hand side of the browser window :

- **Overview**: Displays an overview of your cluster state, load across the nodes in the cluster and its general health based on data replication and availability.
- **Get Started**: Provides a button to import the latest tweets from Twitters public timeline for a data set to experiment with.
- **Console**: An interactive terminal to try queries and view the results.
- **Tables**: Displays Table and partition schema and health.
- **Cluster**: A more detailed view of the health and load of each node in the cluster.

The *Console* tab is most useful right now, allowing the issuing of SQL commands for testing Crate.
