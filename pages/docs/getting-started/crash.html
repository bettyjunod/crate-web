# Crash
Crash is xxx.

The Crash shell can be used from within a node that is part of a cluster (**Not Docker**) or on another machine to connect to a remote cluster.

To launch (**This isn't quite right is it?**) Crash:

```bash
./bin/crash
```

Your command prompt will then switch to a `cr>` prompt. Connect to a cluster using the URL and Crate xx port (_4200_):

```bash
cr> \connect 127.0.0.1:4200;
```

You can then use Crash to issue SQL queries and other commands.
