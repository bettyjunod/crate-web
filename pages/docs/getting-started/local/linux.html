title: Installing Crate.IO on Linux
author: Chris Ward

Crate maintains official packages for Arch Linux, Debian, RedHat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. We recommend you use our 1-step installer that will configure the appropriate package repository and install Crate for you.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L install.crate.io)"
```

If you like to do things manually, here's how.

## Arch Linux
Crate publishes build files to [Arch Linux AUR](https://aur4.archlinux.org/packages/crate/). If you have any problems installing packages from the AUR, full instructions are available on the Arch Linux [Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_User_Guidelines)). Make sure you have installed `build base-devel` with the `pacman -S --needed base-devel` command.

### Download the package

```bash
mkdir ~/builds
cd ~/builds
curl -O https://aur4.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/crate.tar.gz
tar xzvf crate.tar.gz
```

### Build and install the package

```bash
cd crate
makepkg -si
```

### Start Crate

```bash
sudo systemctl enable crate.service
sudo systemctl start crate.service
```

## Debian
We provide Debian packages for the Wheezy (7.x) and Jessie (8.x) distributions. Installing Crate from our repository requires a couple of steps.

### Testing/Unstable Releases
And for Debian Jessie:

```bash
deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main
deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main
```

### Debian Wheezy
#### Install https support for apt

```bash
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

#### Download and install gpg key:

```bash
wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
```

#### Add repository to sources:

```bash
sudo su -c "echo 'deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main
deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list"
```

##### Testing Releases
Testing releases of Crate are available for Debian. Use the following source URLs for Debian Wheezy:

```bash
sudo su -c "echo 'deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list"
```

#### Update sources and install crate

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crate
```

#### Start Crate

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/crate start
```

### Debian Jessie

## Red Hat
The Crate Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based releases, supporting Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux 6, CentOS 6 and Scientific Linux 6.

### RHEL6
#### Enable the Crate YUM repository
All Crate packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, the public key must be installed and then install the `.rpm` containing the YUM repository definition.

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/6/x86_64/crate-release-6.5-1.noarch.rpm
```

##### Testing and Unstable Releases
The Crate Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains development builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting for feedback from testers on functionality and stability. Packages in this repository will change during development, so it should be disabled on production systems. If you want to enable the Testing repo on your server, set `enabled=1` in _/etc/yum.repos.d/crate.repo_.

#### Install Crate

```bash
yum install crate
```

#### Start Crate

```bash
sudo service crate start
```

### RHEL7
The Crate Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based releases. It's supported on Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7, or Scientific Linux 7.

#### Enable the Crate YUM repository
All Crate packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, the public key must be installed and then you can install the `.rpm` containing the YUM repository definition.

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/7/noarch/crate-release-7.0-1.noarch.rpm
```

#### Install Crate

```bash
sudo yum install crate
```

#### Start Crate

```bash
sudo systemctl start crate.service
```

## Ubuntu
We build packages for the Ubuntu versions Lucid Lync, Saucy Salamander and Precise Pangolin. They are available on our [Launchpad page](https://launchpad.net/~crate). Adding the repository and installing Crate requires the following commands:

### Install Crate

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crate
```

### Start Crate
Crate should have been started automatically by upstart and can be stopped or restarted with:

```bash
sudo service crate stop
sudo service crate restart
```

### Testing and Unstable Releases
The Crate Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains development builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting for feedback from testers on functionality and stability. Packages in this repository will change during development, so it should be disabled on production systems. If you want to enable the Testing repo on your server. To enable the Testing Repository on your machine add the PPA:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/testing
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crate
```

 **Important:** Crate requires the latest Java 8 (at least u20 or higher). In order to run Crate on Ubuntu releases older than 14.10 you would need to install Java 8 from the [Ubuntu Backports](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports) repository.
