title: Getting Started with Crate.IO
author: Chris Ward

Crate bundles a complete feature set and makes it as easy as possible to get started. A new and better database is just 5 steps away.

## 1. Installation
Installing and starting your first Crate node is simple and possible on almost any setup and operating system. Where do you want your cluster?

### Local Machine
- [Mac]({% url '/docs/getting-started/local/mac.html' %})
- [Windows]({% url '/docs/getting-started/local/windows.html' %})
- [Linux]({% url '/docs/getting-started/local/linux.html' %})
- [Tarball]({% url '/docs/getting-started/local/tarball.html' %})

### Cloud
- [AWS]({% url '/docs/getting-started/cloud/aws.html' %})
- [GCE](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/solution/click-to-deploy-images/crate?q=crate)
- [Azure]({% url '/docs/getting-started/cloud/azure.html' %})
- [Softlayer]({% url '/docs/getting-started/cloud/softlayer.html' %})

### Containers
- [Docker]({% url '/docs/getting-started/containers/docker.html' %})
- [TuTum]({% url '/docs/getting-started/containers/tutum.html' %})
- [ContainerShip]({% url '/docs/getting-started/containers/containership.html' %})
- [CoreOS]({% url '/docs/getting-started/containers/coreos.html' %})

## 2. Connect to the Cluster
To connect to your Crate cluster, you will need to know the IP or DNS address of one node in the cluster and Crate uses port 4200 for http transport. You have several options available:

- A web accessible [Admin UI]({% url '/docs/getting-started/admin_ui.html' %})
- Crash, a [command line interface]({% url '/docs/getting-started/crash.html' %})
- [An HTTP endpoint](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/rest.html)

## 3. Import Data
It's hard to see what a database is capable of without a real world dataset, we have two sample sets for you to experiment with:

- From the [Crate Admin UI]({% url '/docs/getting-started/admin_ui.html' %}), Click *Get Started* to import some sample Twitter data.
- [Importing your own data](https://crate.io/docs/stable/best_practice/data_import.html)

## 4. Connect an Application
A database doesn't exist in isolation, but powers an application. Crate.IO has a multitude of language libraries to connect and query your database. What language(s) do you use?

- [Java]({% url '/docs/getting-started/clients/java' %})
- [Python]({% url '/docs/getting-started/clients/python' %})
- [PHP]({% url '/docs/getting-started/clients/php' %})
- [Erlang]({% url '/docs/getting-started/clients/erlang' %})
- [HTTP endpoint]({% url '/docs/getting-started/clients/rest' %})

## 5. Scale a Cluster
A distributed, scalable database will grow and change over time to meet new requirements and demands. Crate.IO makes it easy to resize your cluster and not waste time on re-configuration each time. What feature are you interested in?
