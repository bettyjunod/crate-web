title: Connecting to Crate with Python
author: Chris Ward

## Install
Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install the Crate Python package:

```bash
pip install crate
```

Import the client module from the `crate` package:

```python
from crate import client
```

## Connect to Crate
Use the `client` module to create a connection:

```python
connection = client.connect(SERVER_IP)
```

Open a cursor to the database to enable queries.

```python
cursor = connection.cursor()
```
