The company collects geotagged data from over 65 million locations, processing over 20 million events every day, cleaning, matching and categorizing the data collected.

Utilizing Crate allowed AVUXI to gather and process this data faster and more efficiently than any other solution they looked into and the [support for geolocation data](/docs/stable/sql/data_types.html?highlight=geo#geo-point-data-type) was a positive.

<table class="quickfacts">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <div class="fact">800</div>
            <p class="fact-caption">million records</p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <div class="fact">20.000.000</div>
            <p class="fact-caption">events processed every day</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

AVUXI were using a 4 node Crate cluster with approximately 800 million records when they discovered an issue with concurrent INSERT requests.

Thanks to Crate's Open Source nature and swift response of the core team, the issue was fixed quickly in a hotfix release and all users benefited from the issue report.

> "We were going crazy looking more information about how to fix this issue. We really appreciate your efforts and dedication in order to help us as fast as you did."

AVUXI now have two Clusters of three nodes each and continue to recommend Crate to anyone they meet who needs to handle large data sets.

> "It is a pleasure working with companies like yours, that listens and cares about their customers."
