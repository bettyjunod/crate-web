Meet Christian Haudum, aka 'Haudi', one of Crate's integration engineers and a fan of vinyl and dub step.

At Snow Sprint, amongst other things, Haudi decided to create a process monitoring tool for Crate.

## Introducing ctop
### Getting ctop
ctop is built in Python, so clone the repository and use buildout to get the tool onto your system and ready for use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaudum/crate-top.git
cd crate-top
python3.4 bootstrap.py
bin/buildout -N
```

### Using ctop

```bash
bin/ctop --hosts SERVER_IP:4200
```

Where `SERVER_IP` is a comma separated list of Crate instances you wish to connect to, with the Crate transport port appended.

Haudi hopes to add more functionality to the project over the coming months, so keep an eye on it's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/chaudum/crate-top) if you like what you see.
