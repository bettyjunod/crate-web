In [our last blogpost][1] about Crate's spatial and geographic features we announced the support for the `geo_point` data type and related operations.

Since that post, we have greatly improved our geographic features and starting with Crate *0.53.0* we have added a `geo_shape` type ([documentation][4]) to store and work with shapes of all kinds. Together with [JOINs][8] working with geo-spatial data now becomes much easier. First of all, let us look at the new data definition:

## Defining the Data

To define a column of type `geo_shape`, add it as a type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE geo_shapes.all_shapes (
  "geometry" geo_shape,
  "type" string,
  properties object AS (
    "name" string
  )
);
```

Additionally it's possible to add further options to customize indexing:

```sql
CREATE TABLE geo_shapes2.all_shapes (
  "geometry" geo_shape INDEX USING geohash WITH (PRECISION='50m', distance_error_pct=0.025),
  "type" string,
  properties object AS (
    "name" string
  )
);
```

In the above statement, the `geohashing` algorithm ([wikipedia][5]) is used to create an index of each shape with the precision parameter controlling its accuracy (More on that [here][4] and [here][6]). This index will 'rasterize' all data with the defined `PRECISION` - hence a single point becomes a square of a certain size. Similarly, the percentage provided in `distance_error_pct` will control how precise the borders of a shape are stored.

## Operations

### Within

`Within` finds out if a point (or shape) is contained within another shape. Since this can be a costly operation we provide two variants of this operation. Via `match` ([documentation][9]) or by `within`([documentation][10]). The former uses a 'fast' approximate matching (on a grid) which cannot be used to JOIN tables, whereas the latter can be used for JOINs but will also be more expensive since it uses vectors.

### Intersects

If two `geo_shape` planes share any point, this operation will return true. Similar to `within` there's two ways to call this operation. `match` and `intersects`. As before, the `match` variant is faster but less precise.

### Disjoint

`disjoint` is the opposite of `intersects`, it only matches shapes that do not share any points.

## Example: Locations in Berlin

As a short demonstration, we'll use the Google Places API to gather a few locations in central Berlin. After importing and indexing everything with Crate, we can run queries based on GIS data!

### Setup

We are going to use two tables, the first of which will provide information on 60 different localities (gathered from [Google's Places API][2]):

```sql
CREATE TABLE geo_shapes.places (
  "types" array(string),
  "name" string,
  "geometry" geo_point
);
```

The second table will store the geographical information about Berlin's 12 districts:

```sql
CREATE TABLE geo_shapes.districts (
  geometry geo_shape INDEX USING geohash WITH (PRECISION='10m', distance_error_pct=0.025),
  "type" string,
  "name" string
);
```

You can find the GeoJSON data for the districts in this Gist:

### Museums in Berlin-Mitte

Mitte is the central part of Berlin where a lot of the well-known sights, government buildings and museums are located. Since we have location information on both the districts and sights, we can ask Crate for a list of museums:

```sql
select p.name as name
from geo_shapes.places p, geo_shapes.districts d
where d.properties['name'] = 'Mitte' and
      'museum'= ANY( p.types) and
      within(p.geometry, d.geometry)
order by 1;
```

Which results in a nice list of 8 museums (or 7 and a church/museum):

```
+-----------------------------------------+
| name                                    |
+-----------------------------------------+
| Altes Museum                            |
| Berlin Wall Memorial                    |
| DDR Museum                              |
| Gemäldegalerie                          |
| Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe |
| Museum für Naturkunde                   |
| Pergamonmuseum                          |
| St. Hedwig's Cathedral                  |
+-----------------------------------------+
SELECT 8 rows in set (0.038 sec)
```

### The Berlin Wall

During Berlin's separation, there were 23 districts of varying sizes in the city. It was not until 2001 that the number finaly reduced to 12! As a result the Berlin Wall runs along the 'old' district borders and seemingly splits some districts - but which of them were affected? Having the [Berlin Wall][12] handy as a [WKT string][11], Crate can use the [match predicate][10] to quickly find all districts:

```sql
select properties['name'] as district
from geo_shapes.districts
where match(geometry, 'LINESTRING (
  13.36755741412572 52.62579516291058,
  ...
  13.515443690349803 52.40179020052256, 13.515486605693416 52.401633099079156 )')
    using intersects
order by 1;
```

By using `intersects` as a match option, we get all districts that share a location with the wall. Interestingly, exactly half of them were affected:

```
+--------------------------+
| district                 |
+--------------------------+
| Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg |
| Mitte                    |
| Neukölln                 |
| Pankow                   |
| Reinickendorf            |
| Treptow-Köpenick         |
+--------------------------+
SELECT 6 rows in set (0.334 sec)
```

We can also find the districts which do not have anything in common with the (inner) wall:

```sql
select properties['name'] as district
from geo_shapes.districts
where match(geometry, 'LINESTRING (
  13.36755741412572 52.62579516291058,
  ...
  13.515443690349803 52.40179020052256, 13.515486605693416 52.401633099079156 )')
    using disjoint
order by 1;
```

As expected, these are the remaining six:

```
+----------------------------+
| district                   |
+----------------------------+
| Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf |
| Lichtenberg                |
| Marzahn-Hellersdorf        |
| Spandau                    |
| Steglitz-Zehlendorf        |
| Tempelhof-Schöneberg       |
+----------------------------+
SELECT 6 rows in set (0.337 sec)
```

## Conclusion

A `geo_shape` is a flexible way to handle geographical information in Crate and as shown in the Berlin example, can move a significant portion of business logic to the database. We hope that you try this feature out yourself and tell us what you think!
