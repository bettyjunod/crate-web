We're beside ourselves, having been chosen as the winner of TechCrunch Disrupt: London's Startup Battle.  After being selected as one of 14 finalists, we knew we were in good company but also that the competition would be fierce.  Our team rehearsed and fine tuned their pitch, and it payed off!  We are humbled and honored to be chosen the winner amongst such a great group of startups who are all working so hard to become successful.  Our hats off to everyone who participated and to all of the great people and companies who are daring to change the world.
