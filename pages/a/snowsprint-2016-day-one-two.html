[Crate.IO SnowSprint 2016](/snowsprint) xxx

Sorry for the delay in keeping you updated we've been all hammering the Internet, creating pull requests, downloading Tarballs and meaning that working on all our awesome projects has taken that little bit longer.

Project ideas and progress so farâ€¦

### CLI Top tool
Haudi is creating a top-style tool for Crate to display cluster states and health right in your terminal.

### C Bindings / Driver
Adrian and Basti have been working on creating a C driver for Crate.

### 1001 nodes Azure cluster
As we were lucky enough to be gifted  1001 nodes by Microsoft Azure, Jodok and xxx have decided to see quite how far they can push crate, creating a **massive** cluster.

### Updating Mesos Integration
Aslan joined us from Mesosphere to help get our Mesos framework working again as it had slipped somewhat behind in terms of functionality and compatibility.

### Dash / Offline documentation browser
Chris decided to make our documentation work in Dash, the offline documentation browser for Mac, but with equivalents that use the same file type available for other platforms. This involved ensuring that our current documentation was better marked up semantically, such as delineating what is a function, or a method etc. With the framework for doing this in place, this is something that will updated over the coming weeks and look forward to some offline documentation sets soon.

### Demo Improvements

### Jooq
[Jooq](http://www.jooq.org/) is an abstraction layer for JDBC that allows you to create models based on Database schema and Ruslan decided to work on a dialect that will work with Crate clusters and tables.

### Crate Dev Tools
Jordi worked on a set of [developer tools for Crate](https://github.com/mfussenegger/crate-devtools) that provide tools such as filling tables with random data (Using [Faker](http://fake-factory.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)), measuring the run time of a query and with more to come.

### Scrumy Clone
