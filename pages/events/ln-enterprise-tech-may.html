The London Enterprise Tech Meetup fosters innovation in the London enterprise technology ecosystem through promoting early stage technology companies, supporting entrepreneurs, educating companies on how to work with enterprises, and creating an environment where entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses can all network and learn from one another.

Our CEO, Jodok Batlogg is demonstrating Crate.IO's distributed data store at the May event and will be available for questions and exchanging big ideas afterwards.
