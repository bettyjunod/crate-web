Our US team will be representing Crate at South By Southwest this year! We are excited to have Spanky pitching Crate for the SXSW Accelerator for the "Enterprise and Smart Data Technologies" category.  

If you see one of the team ([Lara](mailto:lara@crate.io), [Spanky](mailto:spanky@crate.io), and [Tyler](mailto:tyler@crate.io)) say hello, get a question answered or grab a beer with them. We are looking forward to seeing you there!
