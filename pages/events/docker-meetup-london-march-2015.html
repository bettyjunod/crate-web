Our engineer Christian will be attending the Docker Meetup London on March 3rd 2015.

There will be 4 talks from **Terry Dhariwal** (_Running distributed NoSQL on Clocker_), **Jérôme Petazzoni** (_Deep dive into Docker storage drivers_), **Jessie Frazelle** (_Docker on the Desktop_) and **Luke Marsden** and **Ilya Dmitrichenko** (_Powerstrip_) .

If you're interested in chatting about Crate, let [Christian](mailto:christian.haudum@crate.io) know, there will be also enough time afterwards at the pub!
