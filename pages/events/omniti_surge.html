Meet our CEO Jodok at Surge where heâ€™ll talk about Crate as a Backend of the
Internet of Things: In this talk, he will discuss the ideal data store
architecture for the Internet of Things (or any data intensive application),
its requirement for massively scalable horizontal scaling, the different
approaches to solving query speed issues and more. He will then show how
open source Crate Data addresses these issues with its datastore.
He will also cover some design choices under the Crate hood:
allowing SQL queries vs. full ANSI SQL, dealing with spatial data,
joins and nested objects, and additional architecture and roadmap choices.
