Crate.IO will be attending this pre-eminent event for Nordic and Scandinavian startups.

We will be in attendance for the whole event for networking and discussions on how your startup might be able to benefit from using Crate.IO as a scalable backend. We are keen to meet developers from Helsinki at the same time so if you're interested in chatting, let [us know](mailto:chris@crate.io).
